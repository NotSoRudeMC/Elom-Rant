<h1>Pre-Rant Tangent</h1>
Here it is the <strike>long waited</strike> Elom rant.<br> I know i delayed this a shit ton and i'm not really sorry to be honest here.<br> I left because i felt like i needed to and now i feel like <br>i can come back and have the willpower to even bother talking in Elom.<br> Anyways read on and make sure to read all of it <i>lamo</i><br>
<br>
<h1>A not Disclaimer</h1>
   I have no idea how to begin this so yea have patience with this.<br> I might not be able to properly explain everything so just read through it and come to your own conclusion.
   <br> A lot of the stuff that i say is exaggerated so dont take it to harshly. It's <b>Mostly</b> a joke.<br>Other than that im curious as to how you guys will respond to this.<br> <strike>imprayingnoonegetsoffended</strike>
