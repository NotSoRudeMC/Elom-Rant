     <b><h3>The first Problem: Predictability</h3></b><h6>(edited version)</h6> I guess I'll start with Predictability and there being no reason to chat in Elom.<br>
     With this i mean to say that whenever i say something in Elom and sometimes even before i say something <br> I already know the responses to my message and all other ways that conversation could head in.<br>
     If I already know all the responses then there is <b>no point in saying anything</b> as that is akin to talking to an ai or even <i>talking to yourself.</i> <br>
     Elom has a sort of meta at this point. Every message has a default reply that being something that ends a chat like gg ez or something like snek to mess around. <br>
     Personally this is something that i dont particularly like. I'll take example of a video game to explain this further. <br>
     Now imagine you're playing an idle game( those games where all you have to do is click and idle ig.)<br>
     In this game you play it and grind a ton having tons of fun along the way, now after a few months of playing <br> you settle into a state where each thing you do is something you had planned beforehand. <br>
     You know exactly what You'll do and what will the reaction be and after a while of that you realize that<br> all this grinding and mundaness has gotten to put it bluntly <b>boring and disinteresting.</b> <br>
     This is about the time that you pack up and leave the game maybe returning to it once in a while<br> but as a whole you aren't playing that game and you would rather playing something more fun. <br>
     But surprise surprise friendships and friend groups especially don't work like that. Once a group reaches this state of Mundaness it dies hard, <br> speaking from personal experience a ton of groups i used to send thousands of messages in daily<br> i dont even check up on because of this reason aswell. <br> This also plays into why i decided to make this rant.<br> I dont want Elom to die in the same way that group died.<br>
     I've ranted a lot about this so how about I show some examples of this... oh wait i dont have to,<br> just read my messages about <b>literally predicting what everyone was going to reply with</b> maybe that will help. <br>
     The only way to get rid of this problem is to <i>be original</i> I know that may sound like a tall order but we have to try. <br>I dont want to have to try and keep something this dry and unrewarding alive.<br>
