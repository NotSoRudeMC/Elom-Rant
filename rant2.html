    Now that i think about it this Meta has once already been dealt with when it was<br> banned to use the uno reverse cards which were making all arguments/jokes stale and boring.<br>As this is not a new case i think we can fix this too.<br>
    <strike> I apologize for sounding like a pretentious dickhead here but i had to say what had to be said.<br>Also I'm finna cut out some of the <i>other</i>stuff from this para now.</strike><br>
    <strike>Did i really just cut out a whole ass para omfg.</strike>

<h3>The Second Problem: Grouping</h3> <h6>(mildly edited version)</h6> <br>
Now this one while being a problem is definitely <i>not as much of an issue as the other problems imo</i>.<br>But it is one that has been going on for a <i>long ass time maybe from before elom became a thing even</i>.<br> As for the problem itself, it's that <b>even in our group of a few people we have ended up making sub-groups of sorts</b><br> such as the brawlhalla group and rocket leauge group and the anime group. <br>
Now i'll be honest here i am not against these groups(i am the animeguy here afterall), <br>what i am aginst is <b>leaving other people out of a conversation just because they dont do a thing you do.</b> <br> i try to not do this but it just happens because of the hivemind that we all have in this group.<br>
This contains stuff such as saying someone is bad or something else just because they dont have the same interest as you<br> and anyone who goes against it is a loser and a snek. This shit really annoys me<br> because i dont wanna see us all just having fucking civil wars because of something we like or dislike.<br>
Just by seeing how many times fighting within ourselves has been mentioned and done is insane,<br> this kind of toxic friendgroups rarely last(again talking from experience). I dont want to give examples and callout people<br> but to be honest its fine if you have done it i just hope we can do this less and less as time goes on.<br>
The only type of fighting i think is fun so to speak is friendly banter and the idle gang, dnd gang stuff.<br> This is just the kind of fights friends have but we have in our <br>one hundred and thirty thousand messages on elom on multiple occasions gone too far so to speak.<br>
