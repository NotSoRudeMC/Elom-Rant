        <i>This is the easiest problem to solve so lets try and work on that shall we.</i><br>
        Moving on from this to the third and most weird so to speak problem<br> that you prbably did not expect me to talk about here on the <strike>podcast</strike> i mean rant.<br>
        Anyways <i>*here we go*</i>

    <h3>The Third Problem: Faking it</h3> <h6>(Extremely edited version)</h6> <br>
    While i dont think most of you will get this problem i <br>dont think this is one that needs to be fixed immediately,<br> it's just something that needs to be addressed you know. The actual problem(?)<br> goes something like this: we all are dumbasses who are afraid to tell others how we really are<br>
    and tend to hide stuff from other people, which in my opinion is pretty idiotic.<br> The thing is just that we all hide too much of ourselves and end up being half assed an not able properly interact.<br> I'm going to tell an incident of what i mean to let all of you understand better.<br>
    It goes a little like this: all of us like one thing in this example it's memes and anime,<br> now because of this one of us felt left out and forced themselves to watch memes even though<br> they were getting no enjoyment out of this and were feeling mildly saying "depressed" about it.<br>
    This arises the question of why they felt like this, the answer is that<br> on one side they were doing something they had no interest<br> in and on the other side they were trying to put up a front of oh im enjoying this so much and having such a good time<br> which weighed on their conscious. Thankfully this has been resolved.<br>
    All in all there are two types of "faking" going on, One to make ourselves look like<br> we are better than we really are and the Second is<br> to make ourselves fit in better and make interactions between others easier to have.<br>This is something that will naturally be resolved if we can keep Elom alive so yea.<br>
